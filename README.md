Title: My Jouney

Rated: E for everyone ESRB
Target: Casual gamer (age: 6-14)

Written and coded by: Diego Zelaya


My Journey, is a game with a wacky game-play style looking to entertain rather than focus solely on game play. The genre
is a Platfromer because the player is able to control the character via moving, jumping etc. The music theme for the game
is wacky and unorthodox, the gameplay is a fun. Moving through obstacles, and bouncing on flower platforms to get a heads "up,"
on your journey. The game objective is to get from point A to point B by using any method available to the player to complete the level. The best part of all this is the wacky style gameplay and the song that adds a sence of chaotic atmosphere, but dont get to carried away as you got a long journey ahead of you.
